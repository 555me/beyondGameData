      "en": "Though this wasn't the first time they talked about Bander Scavs, I never really saw one myself.\nPeople can't really appreciate how difficult life could be out there on Talos-II. Band cities and neighborhoods must work closely together to survive, yet many Banders chose to leave the city behind to live as a nomad or prospector in the frontiers.\nI myself wasn't too surprised by this. These people had lost too much. I interviewed around a dozen refugees last week from a disaster-stricken neighborhood that ran out of food. They had no other choice.\nHowever, there were also some who refused to live in a world of law or were simply sociopaths. These individuals preferred a life filled with constant violence and danger.\nRegardless of their intents, no Bander nomads could truly give up the touch of civilization. Also last week, I saw them craft weapons with a scavenged machine tool. I was extremely curious how they managed to get their hands on a working lathe. The answer was simple. They got lucky with a scavenging run through a Bander city dumpsite. These landfills provided for their every need.\nTurned out that Bander Scav was a pretty accurate name for these people.\nIf you're reading this, tell that little Bander journalist to stop stalking me. People who complain about sleeping bags do not belong in the wildlands. She should get back to her cushy Bander place and stick to being a celebrity tabloid writer."

      "en": "I refused to agree with Henry's ideas.\nThe RAYTHEAN motto of making practical products is mere escapism. The form of a weapon is a conclusive result of both traditions and experience. Nature has granted us intuitive senses to differentiate between things that work and things that don't. Elegance and harmony are the unspoken answers for perfection that we arrived at thanks to the countless years of our history and hard-earned experiences.\nAnd I must seize this bid just to prove this point.\n\nI got 9 ways to achieve the level of destruction desired by the client, but none of them should be used by a weapon of this size.\nI also heard that Henry decided to test out his flash-burn impulse technology. Laughable. The client specifically requested a sword, not a cannon with a hilt welded to it.\n\nWeapon performance failed to meet the desired specifications.\nHenry had a short discussion with me. His team was also out of ideas. I didn't know what the client might think if they saw this private meeting of weapon designers from 2 competing companies. \n\nTheir specifications were impossible. Why did the boss agree to take on this contract?\nEven if the dude took the sample prototype to HQ and wanted something with the exact same performance, he would just get another strange artifact unearthed by another bunch of weirdos. We now have more than reputation to worry about. These untested and strange devices pose a threat to our very lives.\n\nI received a flash of inspiration during shower that might just help us meet the minimum specs. I knew bathroom opera would work.\nA stack of 4 core armor slabs of armored vehicles? Hmph. My solution could go through that in a single slash. I doubt if RAYTHEAN has a better alternative. Physics is a hard science with hard limits. We may have our differences, but both of us should acknowledge this truth.\n\nThe Cabal of Tranquility re-activated the prototype.\nIt went through ... a stack of 16 armor slabs. The Cabal intends to run another test with a stack of 32 once emergency repairs for the ceiling is complete.\nThey even proposed a diagonal cut from corner to corner.\nMaybe I should talk to the boss about this."

      "en": "Dear Klamath Bob:\nI received your message. Though I desire to have this discussion in person, my convoy must depart for the Northern Front in 10 hours. It was with some hesitation that I decided to pen this reply. Do be aware that I will have difficulty contacting you via conventional comm devices once the convoy sets off.\nI understand your concerns and I'm very well aware of the sadness and disappointment experienced by your team. As your mentor, you must understand that my decision was nothing personal and must cater to the bigger picture. My opinions alone would not sway the strategies of our marketing department. The fact that your technical blueprints earned no small amount of approval is a testament to the outstanding performance of your designs. You should be confident about that.\nJust two months ago, I was shocked when engineers from the fringe tech department released a working example of a miniaturized centrifugal Originium generator. It shattered the theoretical limits of energy conversion ratios for such devices and would certainly usher in the next revolutionary change for the very foundations of power generation. Even I would have brushed it off as mere hypothetical fantasy just 12 months ago but the truth proved otherwise. I was trapped in a comfort zone that blinded me from the scientific advancements that was within our reach.\nSo, don't let this setback dishearten you or keep you from learning. You are young and your choices are many. Though conventional Originium power generation remains a field with great potential, science and technology are always changing. It is difficult to accept failure, especially after so many years of hard work. But remember that you are an engineer. Do not let emotions affect your objectivity.\nBased on my own experiences, there will be a protracted period of time before the new tech becomes fully adopted. Stories from the Age of Terra often describe noisy old engines with abysmal Originium energy conversion ratios. Despite their poor performance, these engines offered advantages that the latest generators could not hope to provide — reliability and ease of maintenance. The world still has a place for the legacy workhorses and it will be long until they are completely phased out.\nRegardless of what I've said, your product design remains an outstanding work of engineering. I have faith that you and your team will quickly find a new direction.\nI look forward to hearing more about your progress in the future.\n\nYour friend and mentor,\nWillem Sinclair"

      "en": "She saw it more clearly than anyone else.\nStepping through the gate was a journey that was a tad quicker than she had imagined. Her eyes saw illusions and indescribable colors while her skin felt unreal sensations brushing against it. There were flashes of dizziness, bursts of murmurings, and fragments from the past. These were quickly followed by a bitter cold of winter trailing into something even more frigid. Everything felt so real to her.\nShe immediately asked everyone around and they gave her different answers. Some said it was over in a blink of an eye. Others panted with exhaustion and claimed that they were trapped in a stasis for days.\nShe was curious about the things she saw, for curiosity was part of her nature. She spent hours memorizing the patches, lines, and irregular hues of color that covered them. Yet all of them remained ephemeral and meaningless like the whimsical daydreams of spring.\nThen she saw a gossamer-like beam and a clear glimpse of the starry skies unhindered by the Barrier.\nShe witnessed Talos.\n\nTime did not bring sunrise to the polar regions of Talos-II. The huge, new world dominated everyone's view and it gripped her soul with a power that far exceeded the Arts of the Witch King himself. She could not avert her gaze. She could not have imagined how this natural-occurring astronomical entity enraptured her just as knowledge and wealth had seized her every attention. In fact, she was not sure if this view of the Universe could be classified as a natural phenomenon.\nShe took her time to inspect Talos. It was a massive yet almost motionless orb veiled in pale blue and decorated with rings that resembled the fringes of petals, like lovely ribbons that she only saw from her aunt's sewing machine. As she looked on, she realized that the \"motionlessness\" of Talos was a visual trick it played on her. It moved at an almost imperceivable pace and shimmered ever so gently. She could hear the wind.\nHowever, the motions stopped quickly and Talos became an unmoving giant once more. Her heart raced as irregular explosions of thoughts, memories, and ideas surged through her mind. She remembered handing in her first Arts exam when she was still a girl and the moment when she completed her advanced studies at the Spire. She saw her parents, her mentor, the hand that reached out from the devastated ruins, and the flowing sands in the far distance. The last things she saw as she steadied her gait by the dark coastline were her own face, the skies of Leithanien, and childhood friends who counted the stars with her. All of them wore her own face.\nFor the first time in her life, she felt the powerful impulse of passionate love. Her heart yearned for Talos and she would do anything to touch the giant.\nIt was her belief that the giant celestial body was the knot that tied everything together.\nAnd these ties made the Originium flowing within her whisper into a chorus.\nThat was the day when she stopped changing. She must become a long-lived one, like the world she had hopelessly fallen in love with."

      "en": "The Sarkaz was a mountain. He picked me up with one hand and stomped towards a less conspicuous place in Seš'qa.\nThe children nearby pointed at us excitedly. They jabbered to their parents about what they saw and probably mistook this altercation as an audience moment featured in the \"Parade of the Royal Courts\". I was the \"lucky\" guy who got to interact with the Kings of the Royal Court.\nI was also just as excited when my old man brought me to this flying theme park for the first time.\nBut now, it felt as though I was about to be executed by this emotionless and silent Sarkaz warrior.\n\"SORRY! I should've bought a ticket!\"\n\"...\"\nI didn't know if I would end up like the victim shown in the oldies. I could not remember its title, but the poor lad was completely drained of all his blood by an elegant Vampire to fill his dinner goblet.\n\"I ... I had fun at this place when I was a kid! 'Errant's Grand Adventure' was my favorite attraction! I just wanna relive my childhood again!\"\n\"...\"\nI wondered if I would end up like the guy shown in super popular \"Records of the Kazdelian Wars\" manga. The dude was chopped to pieces by a sword as long as the dude himself, thrown into a furnace for fuel, and burned to raging hot ash that scattered to the winds!\n\"NO! PLEASE! I CONFESS! I pick-pocketed parents distracted by screaming kids when they crowded up at the ticket booths! I'M SORRY!\"\n\"...\"\nThat did not work. Perhaps my real intent was already foretold by a Cyclops who secretly dwelt in this City of Witchcraft. That would be the end of me! To hold on to dear life, I decided to spill everything!\n\"STAAAAHHHP! I'LL TELL YOU THE TRUTH! I'm completely broke! And I'm a ... a damn criminal! I might have schemed to steal a creator-signed 'Sundered Prince' from the Witching Hour flagship store just before Seš'qa Open Day ends! But that's just an evil plot! You caught me right after I stepped into Seš'qa! None of my plot ever happened! I PROMISE! I SWEAR!\"\n\"Here's the guy. A real squealer this one.\"\nI crumpled to the floor with a resounding thud. The room was dark. I carefully opened my eyes and found myself upon a soft and well-fashioned sofa instead of the cold, hard floors of a dungeon.\n\"Welcome back, my brave adventurer.\"\nA Sarkaz recited the classic line of Errant's Grand Adventure as she took the seat behind a simple stone table. She was decked out in a fine business suit, leather shoes, and a parade mask.\n\n\"Mr. Maxim from Asphalt Roundabout. Sixteen years have passed since you last visited Seš'qa. Nevertheless, we have held on to your prize.\"\nWait. I thought the host of the \"Errant's Grand Adventure\" was supposed to roleplay as a mysterious diviner witch wearing an ancient courtly dress. Before I could sort out my confusion, a load of bad memories that I had always avoided suddenly surged within me.\nI completed the \"Errant's Grand Adventure\" and could finally exchange my winnings for the final \"Treasure from the Lord of Fiends\" — a most intricately crafted toy sword. It was my childhood obsession. But I missed the final window for prize exchange when the bells tolled and signaled the end of the Open Day. My old man tried to comfort me and said we'd visit again when the flying city of Seš'qa returns.\nBut our days at La Fantoma didn't last till the return of Seš'qa. My old man told me that we were broke and gotta head to the Asphalt Roundabout to \"dodge the collectors\". Of course, I never became a fearless adventurer. Instead, I turned into a petty thief, a dirty smuggler, and a scummy fraud... I only revisited this place because I thought there was a killing to be made.\nThe Sarkaz then removed the cloth to reveal the prize under it. It sure wasn't a toy sword that blinked and flickered when you pressed a button. It was an actual \"Sundered Prince\"! An authentic blade painstakingly fashioned by the witch-crafters! Not only that, the Sarkaz manifested a pen out of thin air and signed the weapon for me.\n\"Are ... are you sure? That prize I missed sixteen years ago... It can't be a weapon of such immense value!\"\n\"I am quite certain. A weapon of a true adventurer, just as revealed by the divination.\"\n\"A divination...? Could I ... beg you to divine another reading for me?\"\n\"I'm listening.\"\n\"Will my life ... ever get better?\"\nThe Sarkaz looked at me and said something, but the only sound that filled my ears were the tolling of bells that signaled the end of the Open Day that I had not heard for sixteen long years. When I returned to my senses, my legs once again found solid ground. People crowded around me. Everyone, children and grown-ups of every race, looked into the air and waved their goodbyes at the Seš'qa amidst the erupting fireworks. I felt like a young boy again as I gripped my blade. I hoped that the bells tolled a little later. I wanted a sword that flickered and shone when I pressed a button.\nBut no. I received something that I wanted and I knew exactly what to do.\nMy grand adventure was about to begin."

Why would he send fresh meat with barely two weeks of training to kill some buggerloids? BECAUSE I ORDERED IT! The only blightery I wanna hear from your pie holes are: \"SIR! YES, SIR!\" Do you friggin' UNDERSTAND?!\"\n\"Or do I have to emphasize this once more? I am your drill instructor! I am the smelter and the quencher! My job description has but one line, and that is to hammer this idea into your empty heads: Fighting buggerloids isn't the same as make-believe Saturday afternoon tea with Miss Applecrumbs!\"\n\"I don't care if you hate me, because sooner or later... you will appreciate my edu —\"\n\n\"— CUT!\"\n\nI got back to my senses and knew I messed up on the same line again.\nDirector Luther rushed over to my face, lividly. He pointed at my nose and roared:\n\"Mr. Hudson! Did a burdenbeast stomp on your mouth? You have FLOPPED three attempts for this simple line! If you fail to deliver this properly one more time, I want you to instantly REMOVE your majestically clumsy turdmaker OUT OF MY STUDIO!\"\n\n......\n\nI returned to the lounge. Dennick, my agent, was frowning. \"Lukas, what were you thinking? I thought you're a top graduate from the New Wrankwood Academy of Performing Arts!\"\nI remained silent and took out the script that was already filled with my personal notes. I drew a circle around the name \"Guy Crerar\" — An officer serving the Order of Steel Oath and the character I was supposed to play.\n\"Guy Crerar is an Oathkeeper known for his incorruptibility and sense of justice. In the prequel of this movie, he's a benevolent instructor who would stand up for his recruits when they are mistreated, and question his superiors when they give unreasonable orders.\"\n\"But what's happening here? Guy has turned into a conceited, self-centered jerk who treat recruits as expendables beneath himself, and under-performing youths as sub-human trash...\"\n\n\"...What are you trying to say?\" Dennick did not seem impressed. In fact, he seemed disinterested in my opinions.\n\nI sighed. I tried to convey my ideas as truthfully and formally as I could to the man who once called himself my biggest \"fan\".\n\"I'm trying to say that this script has serious issues with the portrayal of this character. We already have an Iron Banner trilogy. The key character of its sequel shouldn't be handled in such a crude manner. Guy is also supposed to convey the image of the Oathkeepers in the story. Maybe we shouldn't —\"\n\n\"Come on, Lukas. Let's ease off the sentimentalities already. We're not studying in drama school anymore.\"\nDennick interrupted me out of frustration. He then looked at me with this sour look on his face. A look I knew very well, but never expected him to show it.\n\"You need a clearer view of this entire thing! This isn't Acting 101. You're not in school!\n\"All that stuff on character portrayal and script quality is NONE of your concern. We have the director, scriptwriters, and producers in charge of that!\n\"And that stuff about the 'image of the Oathkeepers'... Don't you know how many recruits we're getting them with this series? I don't see anyone objecting to this!\n\"Look around you! New Wrankwood doesn't need an actors who can't even find his proper role!\n\"You must sort out this nonsense quickly! And please! Try to deliver that scene perfectly!\"\n\nI looked at Dennick. The things he said were irrefutable... He was making plenty of sense.\n\nAnd I was also fresh out of drama school with hardly any say on the important things.\nThe UWST city of Triglava was the furthest place I had been to. I only saw Oathkeepers on screen and in posters.\nNone of the Aggeloi, Northern fortresses, and Oathkeeper spirit had anything to do with me once I take off my costume.\n— And wouldn't that be the truth?\n\nBut they told me they found a retired Oathkeeper to check on the accuracy of the costume. It was even made out of the same fabrics of an actual officer's uniform, and they embellished it with the conspicuous Expeditioner's Medal.\nI could not help but feel something seething deep within me.\n\nAnd thus I raised my head and calmly faced my first and final agent.\n\"I'm sorry, Dennick. I suppose you're right.\n\"This place probably doesn't have a proper role for me...\n\"And this is why I'd no longer fit as the local rendition of Guy Crerar.\n\"— Take care.\" \n\nAnd with that, I left my agent, the termination agreement, and the fine at the lounge. \nThen I left the studio on my own.\n\n......\n\nTwo weeks later, having settled all of my affairs and packing my personal belongings, I went to the largest long distance coach station of New Wrankwood and bought a ticket to the north.\n\n— What happened next?\nI came to this place and completed an application for enlisting in the Order. After several rounds of testing and training —\nI finally earned my place to stand before you, sir."

Ziyuan, help me with my memories. Was it three years ago when I made you the RA to the Xiranite Power Conversion project?\"\nThe RA nodded and gave more details in a low voice.\n\"Yes. Three years, four months, and eight days.\"\n\"Then what about your senior in the lab next door? And then there's Mingshu who's also working on Xiranite. Heard anything about their research progress?\"\n\"Yeah... I did.\"\n\"I'm afraid I got nothing much left to say. Perhaps you can ... consider your next steps. I'm still your mentor, so I'll gladly reserve a recommendation for a project transfer.\"\n\nThe hour was already late when the RA left the research building. The last classes had ended and he could see groups of young apprentices along the streets.\nThe RA took the usual way to Fangxing Avenue. He turned at the second corner and took around seven to eight steps before arriving at the tiny noodle stall.\n\"Braised meat noodles. No scallions.\"\nThe RA took his usual place and ordered his usual noodles. And as usual, the stall owner served the bowl of noodles without a word.\nThe RA took a bite and frowned. The noodle was too tough, and the meat too greasy. \n\"The flavors changed... What happened? Did you hire another chef?\"\nThe stall owner glanced and smiled. He responded, a rare occasion at that.\n\"Boy, everything in this stall, from the noodles to the toppings, are made by me. And I made that bowl from yesterday as well. Perhaps it wasn't my noodles. It was you who changed... And if you're no longer interested in the noodles, why bother coming at all?\"\nThe RA remained silent and then shook his head.\n\"You don't understand, sir... I spent three years on one thing... I kept at it for three whole years. They may have drew the curtains on it, but I'm not going to miss any step of the process... Plus, the noodles from yesterday were better.\"\n\"Hah. You're real stubborn, kid, you know that? You just couldn't give it up, so you tried finding issues with the noodles.\"\nThe RA gave a bitter smile and chose not to continue the argument.\n\"Maybe I couldn't give it up, but what could I do...?\"\n\"The other RAs made significant progress in just a few months. They ventured in the dragon's lair and found its pearl... As for me... I'm still stuck at the same place after slogging at a single project for three years...\n\"I better switch to another project before this gets any worse.\"\nThe RA did not care if the stall owner understood how research works. He unloaded his pent-up bitterness and complaints that he dared not mention to his mentor or fellow RAs. \nThe stall owner stopped smiling and looked at him with a serious expression on his face.\n\"So you want to quit because you couldn't find the pearl.\"\n\"I...\" the RA was speechless and could not respond to the question.\n\"You look like material scientist... Do you remember how many sets of experimental data you've gathered in these three years? How many alternatives you tried? And the number of references you compiled?\"\n\"I think I did ... 353 runs, 172 material alternatives, 561 papers — Wait. No. 562, including the latest,\" he remembered the figures with some difficulty, but listing them suddenly gave him a sense of relief.\n\"Impressive. That's a lot of data right there. I'd say you've created quite the treasure.\"\n\"The results might be important, but the lessons learned along the way are just as vital as well...\"\nThe RA was a little taken aback by these words, and exclaimed these words rather thoughtfully:\n\"I've been a Tianshi disciple for nearly eight years, but it was your simple words that helped me realize something so simple... Thank you very much, sir.\"\nThe stall owner shook his hands and looked as though he recalled something from the past. His gaze looked into the great distance.\n\"That's enough flattery, lad. Nobody likes that here... I just feel bad when I see a fine youth such as yourself think it's the end of the world, especially when it's obvious that there are many wonderful years ahead of you...\n\"My disciples are different. They actually did run into a solid wall. But still they persisted on charging through and carving out their own path...\"\nA smile suddenly creased across the stall owner's face, but it quickly disappeared like the hot steaming fumes given off by freshly-served noodles.\n\"But luck wasn't on their side... Ten years ago, those cheeky brats had the galls to tell me: 'We'll submit the graduation theses once we seal that rift, sir.' None of those blighted little punks ever came back...\" \n\n\"Ten years ago...? What are you talking about...? Wait, you can't be that...?\"\n\n\"I'll ending the story now... Just some sad, stupid tale from a stupid time.\n\"Hey, kid! Stop gawking at me and finish your noodles, damn your eyes!\n\"If the noodles drink in all the soup and goes soggy, you'll know!\""

The Sarkaz was already used to the gaze of hate, the bitter spite against the entity that inevitably ended their lives. The Nachzehrer needed only to devour the haters to soothe his pain.\nHis legs were swollen and felt so hot that he thought they were melting off. Without knowing it, his spine curled together due to pain of hunger and unending rot. When he took the sword of frost from his fathers, he swore to treat it as dearly as his own life. But now, his only wish was to find an inhabited place and trade his old friend for some clean water and food.\nHowever, the abandoned village had none of those. The Nachzehrer was about to leave when he heard crude, mocking ridicule.\n\n\"Oi, Sarkaz. That sword for sale?\"\n\"...Who are you? Mercs or breakers?\"\n\"Hur. Does it matter? If you're good enough, we'll buy you too, devil horns.\"\n\nThe exhausted Nachzehrer did not refuse. He gently clenched his hands into fists and checked his arms for their remaining strengths. \"What do you mean by 'good enough'?\"\n\"See that boulder over there? Cut it in half!\"\n\"Sure. Watch.\"\nThe boulder was large enough that it might take two of him, with arms open wide, to fully embrace it. It seemed to have spent a few years in this village as it was covered with children's drawings and a few words that were no longer legible. The Nachzehrer studied it for a bit and measured his approach.\nThe Nachzehrer stood straight, and raised the sword up high with the entirety of his strength. When the dust settled, he was surprised to find a cave right under the boulder.\nPairs of eyes looked back at him from the cave. They flickered with unease and fear. They were far weaker and filled with even more despair than he was. The mob behind the Nachzehrer laughed loudly and approached.\n\"Hah! That's more than good enough. You're ours, devil horns. Got a price? Spit it out.\"\n\"I'm a merc, not a butcher.\"\n\nAfter the momentary silence, the mocking ridicule erupted once more.\n\"Not a butcher? HAH! This one calls himself a non-butcher! You Sarkaz might have made your fortune, but you're still in the business of killing. Spare us the sermon, devil freak!\"\nThe mob was right. Mercenary work was never clean. He had killed before, and he had no excuses for what he did.\nBut the eyes that gazed out from the cave stared hard at his horns. They were so quiet that it began to hurt.\nWhen he walked through the Cosmic Gate over a decade ago, he thought he no longer had to see these eyes again.\n\"This sword isn't for sale.\"\nThe Nachzehrer took one deep breath and raised his great weapon into the air.\n\"This Sarkaz isn't for sale either.\"\n\n......\n\nThe exhausted and famished frame of the Nachzehrer continued to trudge into the distance.\nTalos-II was not yet at a state where a Sarkaz must sell his weapon."

      "en": "I lived at a small village before I became an Endfielder. It was more like a makeshift camp. Both the UWST and TGCC had plans to develop the surrounding region. The area was jointly managed by the two organizations and we had all sorts of people. Despite the shoddiness of the place, it was lively and boisterous.\nI remember a particular evening when I saw a few Sarkaz squatting in front of the door of my cabin and munching on their rations. They were members of the UWST crew, but none of them had their shirts on and bared their stocky bodies to the wind. All of them were typical Sarkaz, Oripathy-positive and capable of wielding the Arts. They were my people. When they saw me, they gave a rather embarrassed smile and moved a bit so I could leave my cabin.\nAnother UWST crew with the same outfits partied around a bonfire not too far away from them. They laughed, cheered, and munched on the same rations. They danced around the fire and sang songs from their homes.\n\"Munched on the same rations...\"\nI hope you understand what that meant, Supervisor Perlica.\nLife for my people had changed a lot. My Grandpapa had lived for over 200 years and he would tell me stories about Kazdel. The other Talosians might tolerate us more than their ancestors did back in the days when Grandpapa lived on Terra. People no longer feared our Arts and Oripathy was no longer the killer it once was thanks to the efforts of numerous scientists and surgeons. I have many friends of other races and we all received the same education. However, thanks to our innate skills in the Arts and our powerful build, my people and I either became indispensable forces of labor or soldiers fighting against the Aggeloi and the Blight.\nThings might look fair. Every crew mate and worker munched on the same rations.\nBut my people were left alone to themselves. Every race had fun at that bonfire party. Every race except for us.\nSometimes I'd think that the way people tolerated the Sarkaz was by forgetting that we *are* the Sarkaz. Is this a forced construct of \"equality\" built upon a deliberate exclusion and neglect of the differences that separate our histories, cultures, and languages?\nThe Talosian condition was a vast improvement over the Terran injustice we endured. During Grandpapa's times, my people would treat my words as paranoid ramblings and unrealistic demands of a pampered and insatiable child.\nBut I must ask this question. Who can protect the integrity and values of being a Sarkaz? My people would not earn respect if things go on like this. Instead, we could become a domesticated species serving the interests of others... Of course, I do know about Seš'qa, but I cannot bring myself to fully approve the path they have taken.\nI chose to become an Endfielder because I believe that Endfield was not such a place. I was overjoyed to win the approval of my fellow Endfielders. I will also remember the time I spent with the Songseekers of the Circuit as well as the kind words that Martin Marvin Malen lavished me with. But I have my dreams, Endministrator and Supervisor Perlica. I have my own vision for the Sarkaz.\nAnd so, I refuse to become an elite operator. \nThis is not yet the time."

By the time the Oathkeepers approach me for an investment, I wouldn't need your money from your cereal trade no more, Wujek!\nAlright! Has anyone not signed? Good.\nNow since this pot of creds came from our family, it is only fitting that we name the arena after our family... And that's not all! When the Major becomes THE MOST IMPORTANT event in this world, the entire league will bear our name!\n— The Hannicke League!"

She was also dragging some kind of wreck. Called it her \"motor\" she did. Told us that the rocky-crawlies broke it.\nShe askd if I could lend my burdenbeast to her.\nI din't want to.\nI asked who she was, and she tolds me she's a \"Messenger\".\nMessenger? Never head that name before.\nThen she expleyned how a long time ago when the big cosmo gate was still around, Messengers used the gate to bring stoff from Talos-II to Terra, and then bring other stoff from Terra to Talos-II. She sed it was an exchange of longing and attachment.\nBut Da told me the cosmo gate is gone. And so was Terra.\nShe replyed that after the buggerloids were gone, peepo lost fays in each other, started wars, and biult walls around themselves. Just like the lil' sandbeast nearby burrowin into the sand and not coming out.\nWars?\nShe sed people started wars on the buggers and on each other. She sed me and my Da live a wild-land villejj 'cos our peepo wanted to avoid wars.\nAnyways, I din't want to lend her my burdenbeast.\nShe then look into me eyes and got really mean and seerius. She tolds me she needs my burdenbeast so she could go tell the others that the wars ended.\nShe sed we lost our link with Terra but Messengers like her wud try to bring everyone on Talos-II together and biuld trust instead of walls.\nShe then said that she's the first Messenger after the war and how she gots this letter of peece for a person called Endd-Fyodd.\nBut I still din't want to lend her my burdenbeast.\nShe gave me this jentoe smile plus a floating metal ball flowting close to her. She sed its mighty expensiff, worth almost as much as her letter. Tolds me I can keep the flowting ball as a dee-paw-zit until she comes back with my burdenbeast.\nYeah, flowting stoff is usually expensiff.\nSo I agreed and lent her my burdenbeast. I tolds her my name and showed her the way to the villejj.\n......\nWhen I woke up in the morn, someone tolds me that my burdenbeast is hitched outside the villejj. There was a package in the bag, and a letter with my name on it.\nIt turned out to be the Lady Messenger.\nShe wrotes in the letter that I gets to keep that \"deposit\" as a token of her gratitude. She also thanked me and my burdenbeast for helping her get close to her destination.\nShe said the Age of Messengers is coming! I think she was happy when she wrotes that.\nThe package contains this \"comms radio\" with some instructions. Now everyone in the villejj can use this \"radio\" and call other Messengers nearby.\nBut who shud I wryt to? And where should I send my letter? I never left my villejj.\nMaybe I should wryt to that Lady Messenger."

      "en": "There was a time when I was confused about life. The underground arenas of the Asphalt Roundabout is usually the first consideration of people of my size and stature. But the desolation of the place shocked me. That was not the place where I'd want to spend the rest of my life in. So I went to La Fantoma, a city of opportunities and a gathering place for the rich and famous! There are cartel joint sessions, forums, and expos! EVERYTHING!\n......\nOne year passed and I splurged all my savings on a vehicle. Some charitable merchant helped me convert it into a nomadic resto, which happens to be the one right here. And I call it a \"boat\" since it's next to the sea. My \"pier\" is where I moor my \"boat\". I even found a few assistants back then. Made a ton of serious creds during the Obsidian Festival when the entire place was packed with tourists.\n......\nBut two years later, I found more and more people doing my thing. They drive up to the place with their truck and started serving the tourists. The Obsidian Festival made and unmade my fortunes... They built more and more fancy hotels but I am I getting less and less diners? During that year, I saw a Feline who was just like me. Splurged his entire fortune and ended up with nothing...\n......\nThree years had passed. I didn't know how long I'd stay afloat. Revenue was dwindling and that Perro made it worse! The stinkin' mutt always parked his food truck opposite mine, and he had the galls to come over to my place and tell my diners that I was almost finished... I felt like killing that bloody runt.\n......\nI was the last one on the \"boat\". I started packing my stuff and planned to drive my \"boat\" back home. But that was the same year when La Fantoma got hit by a tidal wave. When the disaster ended, an Endfield medical SAR team arrived... How has this got anything to do with my store? It's got nothing with my store, but I strode out one night and heard the Endfielders admiring the star-like beauty of this place. I looked around and saw the dark beach cluttered with seashells brought ashore by the great waves. Some of them gave off soft, gentle glows. I suddenly remembered how we used to see all this when they just got the fest going and the crowd was still small. I suddenly had an idea, mortgaged my \"boat\" on the following day, got myself some glowing shells, and decorated them with various accessories. That's right. You're holding the very same thing. What happened next? Well, we got even more \"piers\" and my \"boat\" is coasting along real easy. \nI'll let you in on something. I'm planning to take a contract over this beach. Yes, that's right. The one beneath your feet. I'm going to grind these shells down to create the Evenglow Coast! I even figured out the name — Dreams of the Stardust Sea. Maybe the organizers of Obsidian Festival will choose my beach for their next evening event. Make sure you visit, 'cos I'll get you a fat discount.\nWhat happened to that stinkin' mutt of a Perro? Oh, he's right over there. We're partners now. Why did I choose him? 'Cos business people of La Fantoma are all about helping each other out. That's how we made this place."

      "en": "I once had extreme confidence.\nConfidence for my gifts in wielding the (applicable) Originium Arts. And my gifts were rare indeed, even when taking every caster of Talos-II into account.\nI believe all of my Arts instructors I had since my childhood could attest to this fact, and there were 23 of them.\nWhile my peers struggled to light a candle with an Arts Unit, I was debating the possibility of having an unaided Infected cast the Arts for extended periods time and at higher throughputs... It was a time when I first heard about the legendary Endministrator. Back then, at least, I once believed that I might be capable of achieving the same.\nMy performances in the Originium Arts Proficiency Assessment for the last 20 years, my GPA from the courses on Originium Arts theories during the academy, and the accolades I received for my graduation thesis titled The Gap Between Practical Applications and Theory — A Discourse on the Future of the Originium Arts, only served to strengthen my belief as I spent every year perfecting my Arts. There is a significant possibility that I am a \"genius\".\n— And I held on to that belief until I joined the company that I have dreamed about since my childhood. Endfield Industries.\n\nI could hardly describe my feelings when I underwent the routine integrated physical examinations for new employees and received the report.\n— My Originium Arts Assimilation was rated as \"Standard\". How was it possible? They must have made a mistake.\nAt that moment, I felt as though I was struck by the devious Arts of a Djall, and it struck so hard I could fight off the mental fog.\nWhen I came to my senses, I went straight to the Human Resources Division and delivered a severe protest. I demanded a re-examination and declared my absolute refusal to accept such a brusque conclusion made without sufficient evidence.\nThe HR Division seemed to be expecting my applications. I was entreated by Martin Marvin Malen in a most sincere manner.\n\"...We understand your requests and have arranged two additional Originium Arts Assimilation testing sessions after three working days. A total of two operators will also be assigned to take the tests with you and serve as control references.\"\n\nThree days later —\nAs per the instructions, I cut out a perfect square out of a ferric slab before me with my Arts Unit. I turned around saw the Savra who should be at the opposing testing station. He looked at me curiously.\n\"Is this the way to do it? I thought I had to cut 16 squares with a single move!\"\nThis is my confession. I thought I heard him wrongly and subconsciously gazed at the results of his test... And I saw sixteen perfect squares neatly laid out on the floor of the training cabin. The clock stopped at exactly 1 minute and 1 second.\n— What was I doing at that time? Oh, I just finished calibrating my Arts Unit and thought about the perfect approach to start cutting the slab.\n\nThere was no question that I lost the first trial. It was a complete disaster.\nBut negativity had yet to catch up to me. I simply prepped for the second session. I comforted myself with this thought: \"Endfield's a big place, and they have a legend like the Endministrator. A fellow Endfielder of such competence ... should be something to expect.\"\nSoon, an accident, or the stroke of Fate ... dawned upon me.\nWhile I was checking the Arts Unit, an Ægir youth wearing an elite operator's uniform poked his head out of the training cabin. He simply wagged his tail and undid the safeties of over fifty standard Arts Units. They orbited him like an obedient school of fins as he left the place and mumbled these words: \"What a hassle... Shouldn't have come here at the first place...\"\nThis was when I first experienced despair from seeing an \"unattainable gap\" that could never be closed.\nI learned that even if I mastered every form of Originium Arts to my knowledge, the tracelessness and effortless elegance of his Arts wielding were qualities that I could never achieve...\nNever, not in my entire lifetime.\nI suddenly felt that all my achievements in the Arts for the last twenty years only gave me better knowledge of what I witnessed at a particular moment in life — I am not the prodigy. That title belongs to someone else.\nI chose to forfeit the second testing session.\n\nAfter the test, I also gave up joining the Specialist Tech Division. Thankfully, the Arsenal took a good look at my CV and asked if I was interested in doing some weapon engineering.\nI agreed.\n\nThey said that the classic \"Arts Identifier\" would be returning for the Arts Unit Obstacle Challenge this year — I received five of those, but I would not mind getting a sixth."

You gotta trust me. Once you hear my tale, you'll understand my perspective and STOP treating me like a lunatic with a freakish fetish for this spear. You might even decide to release me from this jacket and wheelchair.\nAnd I swear it'll be a simple story. Promise. Four years ago, or 1522 days to be precise, six Valley IV security officers on a mission to rescue a family trapped in the wilderness ran into an Aggeloid ambush. There were ten of them. Ten blasted buggerloids with zero sympathies for the living. The conclusion was simple. You probably guessed it right.\n\nOnly two lived to see the next sunrise.\n\nYeah. Just the two of them. The strongest officer no longer had a weapon. He was surrounded by the corpses of his entire team. The man stood before a crying child and stared down at a badly damaged buggerloid. Its deadly appendages were shattered, but the beast of rock could still charge and crush both the man and babe with its bulk. The officer thought hard... What could he do? He was without a weapon...\nBut the officer quickly found a solution, thanks to Endfield Industries. Endfield lances featured field-fitting modular components, so...\nHe took the spearhead from his captain, salvaged the essence module from ██████'s hands, acquired a third of the shaft from ██████'s broken bones, pulled out the second part of the shaft from ██████'s back, and pried out the final part of the shaft from his wife's very skull.\nThe officer emerged victorious with his new weapon. He took the child to Valley IV and the lance was passed on to...\nHold on. Why do you look as though you just figured something out?\nAm I the survivor? Is that why I've named this weapon Chimeric Justice?  Was I that child? Am I doing my best to repay the act of heroism?\nNo. You got it all wrong.\nTake a good look at this lance. A standard Endfield product.\nGood. Now take a good look at me.  I had nothing to do with the story. I came into this world as a sickly runt with many broken parts.\nBut... My retina, my heart, my blood, and every fiber of my being are crying out... Listen to the howling souls that sacrificed themselves for humanity to survive!\nI refuse to sit and rot at this place.\nMy destiny is to become the TRUE Chimeric Justice!"

      "en": "The city had many families. No one knew which of these families was the most friendly and harmonious. But everybody agreed that the Webers were the antithesis of peace. Rarely has there been a family with so many children and so many feuds. Only one Weber should be present in an area of sixty-four square klicks. If more Webers were present, the unfortunate land would soon witness violence and bloodshed.\nJust last month, the eldest of the Weber children received a letter on the battlefield. After butchering the enemy who stood before him, he found his officer and applied for one-month of leave and embarked on a journey home. He crossed the woodlands and found his younger brother who was about to bury the axe into the elder Weber's head when the latter suddenly read the contents of the letter. The younger Weber tossed the axe, packed a few things, and joined his brother on a long journey.\nTheir sister was already waiting on a boat moored at the riverbank. The Weber boys were wary of the massive oar she wielded. Last time they were careless and woke up three days later.\nTime was running out but they still had a lengthy journey ahead.\nThe three siblings faced a vast desert. When they were lost amongst the dunes of ever-changing shapes, a convoy arrived on time. The driver of the lead vehicle lowered the window and revealed a face they all despised and hated beyond all measure — Uncle Weber who lived miles away but never failed to show up and gloat at the family whenever they met difficulties.\n\"Hop on, brats,\" Uncle Weber offered a ride to the young Webers and ignored how they rolled their eyes. The other vehicles in the convoy honked and rushed them along. The frustrated cacophony undoubtedly hid a great number of Webers as well.\nThe convoy started off at once and left ephemeral trails upon the sands. They drove all through the night and day before finally arriving at the final stop. The lake was at peak water level, swollen by a storm that threw great waves crashing at its banks. Thankfully, the richest of their aunts owned a strong, majestic ship capable of accommodating every single Weber.\nAunt Weber the Captain proudly strolled the rolling decks as the ship tore through the storm and rode the waves, giving snorts of disdain to every Weber who failed to keep their stomach juices in, and grunts of contempt to the discolored Webers who held on to the railings for dear life. The tempest accompanied them throughout the journey, and all the Webers arrived at their homeland safely.\nEveryone was shocked to see the Webers charging across the main avenue for the biggest hospital in town. There were so many of them that they covered the entire length of the road.\nAnd the Webers finally gathered at the ward and surrounded a baby girl still in her wrappings. The infant weakly opened her eyes and looked at everyone present before closing them forever, untouched and untainted by the mundane affairs of the mortal world.\n\"Thank you for agreeing to see her one last time,\" the youngest of the Weber girls said softly as she cuddled the child whose body grew colder and colder."

No. They simply realized that the host of Aggeloi could crush entire mountains with their weight of numbers alone.\n......\nI humbly propose to arm our common soldiery with lances and spears. These ancient weapons will find new purpose in the Aggeloid crusades. The length of the weapons will let our soldiers attack these abominations from safer distances and the sharp, tapered tips should be sufficient to puncture their defensive shells. We must also design new arms strong enough to withstand the weight of these inorganic creatures. And the tips require sharper tips. The sharper, the better.\n......\nI've sent my blueprints to our headquarters.

Trained as a scientist, Shayen successfully steered his rationality to govern his mind and actions for the past few months. He understood the challenges faced by humanity on Talos-II. Northmarch Support Hub had taken on an immense mission. Space exploration must make way for more pressing matters and important projects.\nBut as Shayen packed and moved his personal belongings from the lab he worked at, he could not help but look at the two volumes of Ferdinandian Physics on the bookshelf. An indescribable sense of emptiness and defeat washed over him. He reviewed his life. Everything he worked for and loved became mere exhibits covered by canvas.\nShayen remembered the childhood fairytale about Dusk Beauty Flying to the Moon, the teenage science fiction novels of high adventure in outer space he read as a school kid, and the empirical laws laid down by the legendary physicist Ferdinand Clooney. He had always felt that his soul was never trapped to a single world.\nFor the past 40 years, Shayen spent most of his time working on Originium propulsors, heat and Blight resistant materials, processed and compressed Originium fuel, and other technological instruments and products too esoteric for the laypeople. He worked with teams who shared his vision of reaching out into space itself. Though he never saw Terra, he had faith that she existed somewhere in the infinite cosmos. To reach out for the stars was to start a journey of endless questions, results, and answers.\nShayen made an important decision that night. He ignored the regulation that required him to archive years of his research notes and results. Instead, he secreted a copy into a data disk along with the blueprints. He then contacted the director of innovations and science at Northmarch Support Hub. Many of the world's brightest minds toiled for years on these next-gen technologies. Even if the descendants of Terra no longer yearned for the stars, these discoveries and knowledge will help them explore the new world of Talos-II.\nHe must give meaning to everything they had done."

      "en": "My ancestor was a well-learned man who lived at Shangshu. During one of his journeys, he encountered a sudden downpour that forced him to seek shelter beneath the cliffs. He made a warming fire with dried grass, and was about to sleep when he saw a strange individual wearing jet-black clothing. The entity had no eyes nor mouth and its arm was joined to the mountain itself. My ancestor thus asked this strange entity: \"Sir, why is your arm joined with the rock?\" \nThe strange being replied: \n\"I once lived in Baizao. One day, I dreamed of a tiny figure dressed in yellow who stood in the middle of my palm and it asked me about the weight of human life. 'It is heavier than the mountains.' I answered.\n\"The tiny figure smiled and replied: 'And I am the Ruler of the Kingdom in the Palm.' And with that, the tiny figure disappeared and was never seen again. I did not want to overturn its kingdom, and thus I placed my hand upon this very place and did not move it for a century. As the years passed, a great mountain gradually rose from my palm. You are looking at it right now.\"\nMy ancestor was confused and asked: \"You are a kind and caring soul, but why allow yourself to be trapped here for so long? Your concerns are genuine and true, but why don't you severe your hand and be freed from this place?\"\nThe strange being mused: \"I do not know which weighs more — the Kingdom Upon the Palm, or the Palm Before My Wrist. Perhaps if I found the answer, I would be able to bear the weight of this mountain and travel with it.\"\nThe strange being then continued: \"Now, leave me in peace, and you shall have yours.\" With that, my ancestor fell asleep. Dawn broke, but the strange being was not seen again. \n\nI also heard about a herb that goes by the name Zhenhuang. The grass is mildly toxic and burning it generates hallucinogenic fumes. Perhaps this ancestor of mine had breathed in a whiff too many!"

      "en": "He had imagined his reunion with Ludson Walker countless times —\nMaybe Mr. Walker could be hired as a military consultant for some New Wrankwood war movie and receive both respect and questions from the movie crew. Maybe Mr. Walker could appear before the library of Morospolis as a representative of the Order of Steel Oath and talk about an Oathkeeper's life with young UW crew mates. Maybe...\nThere were countless possibilities, all of them fitting for his fellow Oathkeeper, the \"rising star\" of the Order, and the glorious soldier who always fought at the very front. But the actual reunion was the complete opposite —\nHe saw the man who resembled Ludson on a coach to La Fantoma. \"Ludson\" carried an electric guitar on his back. He sighed at a poster for the Obsidian Festival as though he encountered a major problem. Perhaps he misread the coach schedules.\nTo ensure he only \"mistook another person for an old comrade\", he approached the middle-aged man and performed a standard salute, hoping to get or see \"what the hell\" or \"friggin' nutcase\" from the man. Unfortunately, his hopes were dashed when the man's face transformed to be a joyous surprise and shouted out his name.\n\"Bucky?! Is that you?!\"\nThe middle-aged man who resembled Ludson ... happened to be Ludson himself. He counted the number of people throughout Talos-II who would call him \"Bucky\". That number was no more than five.\n\"Geesh, how many years have passed since we last met...?\" Ludson looked seriously engaged in the counting and sighed heavily when he arrived at the figures, \"Ugh. Close to twenty years! Time really does fly...\"\nBucky nodded and before he could think of a proper response, Ludson continued his nostalgia.\n\"You're the one in our banner who always talked about getting a discharge... I even made a bet with Vincent and friends if you'd be the first to pack and scamper home.\n\"And I lost the entire thing! Vincent, that sorry sod, was the first to quit. He...\"\n\"Wha...? WHY?\" Bucky could not help but interrupt, \"What happened to the saying, 'I'd only leave my life upon the fields of war'...?\"\n— Even the most experienced hero and veteran did not make it to the last.\nLudson became silent, his smile suddenly froze on his face. The middle-aged man who gripped the music festival poster in his hands only continued to speak after a pause.\n\"I never thought you'd be the first to ask me that question... Even the Castellan stayed silent when I submitted my discharge papers.\n\"But if you really want an explanation — I just gotta say... I found myself started getting the frights.\n\"I started to fear recon missions in the exclusion zones beyond the Aurora. The endless horde of buggers that grew tougher by the day began to scare me... I don't want to face them anymore...\n\"I felt it... I felt the virtue of 'courage' slipping away from my body and I couldn't find anyways to keep it within me. There will come a day when I grow too weak to even hold on to it.\n\"And since I couldn't hold on to my guts and balls, I might as well say my goodbyes in an honorable fashion. Voluntary discharge was my way... I don't want to wake up shaking like a spineless deserter pissing myself in a cave after running away from a rock bugger I can't beat.\"\n\n\"...But what's this? Why are you carrying an electric guitar?\"\n\nWith that question, 46-year old Ludson Walker gave his signature smile of radiance that he always wore 20 years ago.\n\"This? Oh, it's a wonderful weapon that I found myself pretty good at.\n\"It still sputters occasionally, but it works for me and my comrades...\n\"My toy and my band mates are pretty accommodating. When I'm not a guitarist for a third-rate heavy metal band you've never heard of, I can still think about which of these guitar strings I can use to strangle a buggerloid and twist its blighted head off.\""

      "en": "Regarding the Feasibility of Using Aggeloi as Cost-Effective Tools\n\nI have fully reflected upon my last letter where I proposed to treat the Aggeloi as \"potential clients\", to which you correctly criticized as an act of misguided error on my part. However, my core philosophy has remained the same. We should not treat the Aggeloi purely as an enemy, and our studies on their other potential roles and/or uses should continue.\nFirstly, there is no evidence suggesting that all Aggeloi are under the control of Ankhors or the great nemesis in the north. A significant number of Aggeloi may have exhibited destructive behaviors, but their actions were not governed by any logic and we failed to discern any higher objectives thereof. Thus, the Aggeloid modus operandi can be safely considered as part of their natural instincts. And our own natural instinct is to take inspirations from various creatures (and I know Aggeloi aren't beasts!) and invent things that benefit human civilization.\nMuch has been achieved throughout the last century, the same century during which we strove to build a strong foundation upon Talos-II. However, we hardly made any progress in our understanding of the Aggeloi. The only thing we elicited was displeasure from the Sankta who felt extremely offended by how we decided to name these creatures. Our lack of knowledge about the Aggeloi is a travesty. I beg you to acknowledge the importance of my pursuit and offer a grant large enough to continue my research.\nThat being said, my team (which comprises my son) successfully captured a small Aggelos specimen in the wildlands. It was slightly smaller than an Originium Slug and resembled a clawbeast pup. Perhaps you think I would attempt to domesticate it, but that was not my intent. If that were possible, someone would have done it during the last hundred years. My objective was to identify parts of the creature that could be of use to us.\nInstead of physical or mechanical connections, the academic consensus believes that there exists some form of an energy or magnetic field between the Aggeloid tagmata and the \"joints\" of their 4 (and sometimes 8) segmented appendages. Field researchers had already provided witness reports of the Aggeloi \"activating\" these fields.\nPerhaps the working principles of this Aggeloid articular spatial field can be used in actual applications. Attaching Aggeloid components to 2 articulating parts of a robotic servo arm may provide the machinery with a ready and endless source of power.\nWith that in mind, I came up with an ingenious invention at my own residence — Aggeloid Auto-Nutcracker! I fashioned this particular device by attaching small, excised parts of an Aggelos onto a makeshift ram and base made from cast metal. Placing a walnut on the base and \"contracting\" the Aggeloid articular spatial field generated sufficient force to crush the walnut.\nI believe similar setups can be applied to other applications, so long as we find Aggeloid components of the right size and shape.\nAttached are detailed blueprints and instructions of the Aggeloid Auto-Nutcracker. I certainly hope to hear from you soon."

You might treat this job as a frontiers run, but it's more like a southward trip towards the safe zone for me. Our bases are also better stocked in these parts, so ... I guess I didn't really have to spend any money either way...\"\n\"That sounds ... hmm ... boring ... I guess. Oh! Dang it! Nearly forgot about this!

I got to keep this as a souvenir.\"\n\"So why did you...\"\n\"Because 'Innovation Makes Future' became Innovation Makes the Big Bucks. I just can't stand seeing new tech being used solely for profit. Look ... RAYTHEAN is a good company, make no mistake about that... Maybe it's just me who's weird... Anyways, we need to stick together to survive the frontiers. Things would be better if there were more Raytheanites out here, right?\"\n\"You have a point, but... Wait. I'm hearing a ringing noise...\"\n\"It's my comm device. My fellow crew mates must have noticed something wrong with my positioning signals. An SAR team should be on their way. We should try to get closer to the area's border.\"\n\"Wow. You're a true survivalist! So, uhm... You're really ... not thinking about rejoining RAYTHEAN? They may have bonuses for returning Ex-Rays... Being a Re-Ray might be...\"\n\"Get moving already.

      "en": "Interested in the story of the messenger named Falken Gravning?\nHardly any Terran remembered his name. What they did remember was his job — a Catastrophe Messenger.\nFalken was born in the borders of Kazimierz and started this lonesome career when he was but a young man. With sturdy steps he hiked across mountains and navigated rivers to bring verified data of Catastrophe signs to villages, towns, and cities facing inevitable destruction. He was not a savior. The only thing he could do was to warn people of the \"impending footsteps of annihilation\". Some were grateful, while others bore grudges. He suffered more than a few wounds, vile curses, as well as cold, hateful gaze over the years, and witnessed grave sacrifices as well. Suffocating depression constantly loomed over his soul.\nWhen he turned 53, he decided to leave his homeland behind and devote the final years of his life to the newly discovered planet — Talos-II.\nHere in the new world, he was no longer a \"prophet of doom\" but a mere common messenger. For those few short years, the serene, open expanses of Talos-II was free from Catastrophes and the ever-present threat of destruction. A sense of long-absent peace filled Falken. He took his backpack and roamed the lands between the pioneering bases, delivering letters, escorting supplies, and conveying intel with every trip.\nWhen he had time for himself, he continued to travel alone. He even cobbled together several Originium devices to create a rudimentary aircraft. Though it flew awkwardly across the skies, he could land it upon unexplored wilderness. He climbed majestic peaks, waded through dark swamps, and left his footprints in this untouched realm.\nHe started to picture a beautiful future for the land untouched by Catastrophes — Once he retires, he would build a wooden cabin in some valley. He would also have a mountaintop summer retreat where he could enjoy clean, refreshing air. His notebook was filled with trails, routes, contour maps, and ideas for his \"ideal home\". As he spread footprints across the world, more and more of the blank areas were filled.\nUntil that very day.\nThe day when the Ankhors fell from the skies and the Aggeloi descended upon Civilization. People were once again forced to flee as they had done with Catastrophes struck.\nDuring the era of chaos, Falken once again took up his old profession. He became the most reliable guide and led the survivors in a desperate southbound trek of survival. People said he stepped up to the challenge in numerous occasions to mark out the road forward. He even flew that ramshackle aircraft of his into the storm, and returned with a beaten and badly wounded body. With experience, grit, and courage, he paved multiple trails of life for the refugees. Numerous outposts, villages, and towns were founded thanks to his way markers or verbal directions. Without Falken as their guide, many would fail to reach the Civilization Band alive.\nBut that was not the end of Falken's journey.\nDuring the last years of his life, Falken continued to journey south. He traversed the mountain ranges and roamed the entire Band until he finally arrived at the edge of the great ocean. Legend then claimed that Falken built a ship at that very place and sailed off to find a place even further south.\nAnd Falken was never seen again after that.\nA particular story was rather popular amongst the oceanic navigators of Talos-II: Should one see a cloud, shaped like a raised mast with full sails at the place where the oceans and heavens meet, that would be \"Falken's Sail\", and that would be tidings for good weather.\nPeople call him the \"Navigator\". Falken's story was told in every city, school, and port. He was a messenger, a pathfinder, a lonely traveler, and the one who raised the beacon high during humanity's hour of darkness.\nMieszko Industries is proud to uphold this concept. Our latest series for this year have been imbued with the spirit of the Navigator. We dedicate it to every ambitious and courageous individual eager to face the boundless future.\n\n\"This is just a promotional tale. Is this all I'm going to read?\"\n\"Of course not. I'm about to introduce this latest paper on the untold secrets of Falken Gravning.\"\n\"Oh?\"\n\"Falken Gravning kept going south because of his belief that another undiscovered Cosmic Gate may exist in the south pole of this world.\"\n\"Another ... Cosmic Gate? Is that even possible?\"\n\"Who knows? Nobody could prove nor disprove it. Who knows? He might have found a way home at the end of the sea, or simply disappeared beneath the waves.\"\n\"So...\"\n\"So towards the end of his life, what kept the 'Navigator' going wasn't his passion for exploration or adventure. It was a far more deeper desire — He wanted to go home.\""

      "en": "The Sankta navigated through the battlefield and stopped by a severely injured UWST crew mate. She stooped over and made a cursory check of the wounds. The crew mate was unlikely to survive until the arrival of a qualified medic.\n\n\"May you finally find eternal rest. Aeternam habeas requiem.\"\n\nThe Sankta held his hands and prayed that the poor soul may find peace.\nHow many like him had she found? Thirty? Or three hundred? The Sankta tried to remember as she held the hands that were already growing cold. She felt the rocks and dirt move behind her and drew her handcannon at once — An Aggelos, with a flickering halo above its head.\nThe Sankta slowly approached the paralyzed Aggelos. It was no longer a threat. Half of its body was already pulverized by the artillery of the Worker's Guard.\n\nShe had a question that she knew could not be explained by the things she saw in this place. Ever since the Cabal of Tranquility activated its Nomadic Monastery upon Talos-II, and ever since the Sankta witnessed the first Aggelos, they — we were destined to seek the answers on our own, for none could ever respond to that question.\n\n\"By the graces of the Law, lead me to the journey home...\"\n\nEvery Sankta of the Cabal knew how to sing this anthem. They sang the song as they bathed in the gazes of the saints and crossed the Cosmic Gate. They sang the same song when they traversed the ruins scattered across the world of Talos-II.\nShe still remembered the story that Abbess Vronta said during morning prayer: During ancient times that predate the oldest annals, the Teekaz who sought the Lord's protection became the Sankta. And during the time when the Lord left the Temple, the First Saint revealed her Teekaz form to the Sankta. But this story only filled her with confusion.\nIf the halo was the Lord's exclusive gift to the Sankta and only the Sankta, then what about the hosts of lifeless yet animate constructs called the Aggeloi of Talos-II? Where did their halos come from?\n\nOr rather, who was the one that made you?\n\nSankta gripped her gun tightly. No one could answer her question. The only thing that felt real was the weapon in her hand.\nSoon, the final Ankhor disappeared from the horizon. The steam whistle of victory echoed throughout the battle lines. Once again the UWST pioneers pushed deeper into the frontier. This was the moment when the Civilization Band finds another secure footing in the desolate lands.\nWhile those around her cheered, the Sankta placed both her hands on the head of the \"dying\" Aggelos. She thought she had felt something pulse within the supposedly unfeeling abomination ... but the feeling quickly gave way to empty silence.\nThe Lord may have blessed the Sankta with their halos, but this blessing may have been granted to others. She kept thinking about what this might mean until faith once again filled her heart. It was at this moment, and at this very place, that the Sankta from the Cabal must perform another mass for the departed.\n\n\"No matter where you are from, may you finally find eternal rest. Aeternam habeas requiem.\"\n\nThe rocks cracked and disintegrated as dust leaked out through the gaps between the Sankta's fingers. The flickering halo finally dissipated into the air."

I kept telling her to change out of her crew outfit first. I felt I wasn't getting hugged by mom. I was getting crushed by a hardware store and always ended up with a mess of sore, reddish imprints of hammers, pliers, wrenches, and even a big blasted handcannon on me.\nAnd then she bought me those friggin' buggly toys, you know. I've been seeing actual cranes, drill crawlers, dumpster trucks, crushers, and pile drivers in real life. I saw entire fleets of steel giants heading north every friggin' day and every friggin' year of my childhood. I did not want mini and fake versions of them in my toybox.\nAnd mama never treated this world as \"home\". She never stopped saying: \"Talos-II is just too dangerous. We'll never make this our place.\"\nI'm a Talosian, born and raised, and could never really understand why she never stopped complaining. Yet those words left an imprint on me, like those hardware tools she carried when she gave me those powerful, crushing hugs. I never knew what \"imprints\" meant back then.\nThen came a day when mama failed to come back from the north. Uncle Walther gave me her outfit. Them laundry crew didn't wash it right and it still had this dark bloodstain on the collar. I held it tight to feel the familiar coarseness of the fabrics and the cold, hardness of her tools. And then I found that blasted handcannon — the big iron responsible for all those painful imprints I suffered. The thing sported a new dent beneath the barrel.\nShe emptied the magazine and then slapped an Aggelos real good with that big slab of iron.\nI asked Uncle Walther to cast me a new barrel and furnish it with a chain cutter. I also got mama's position when another convoy roared for the north.\n\n'Cause I'm the hardest wedge to be hammered into Talos-II."

Unfortunately, the author of these notes was just a simple, homicidal brute.

His writings picked up speed and alacrity.\n\"Peripheral rot is a condition that plagues every civilization. This cancer is always there and can never be truly cleansed. However, we must demonstrate our firm resolve and initiate the strong measures to completely sterilize this malignant presence.\"\nHe then concluded his own writings with one final line.\n\"I spent thirty years of my life as a Landbreaker.

      "en": "A formal challenge to all modern \"avant garde\" artists of Talos-II\n\nTo those who call themselves the great masters of the \"avant garde\":\nHow are you doing? I'm specifically talking to those who spraypaint shapes on the walls of ruins, the howlers of underground dive bars in La Fantoma, and anyone who fantasized about having a hand in creating \"unprecedented\" works of art.\nI gotta tell you a brutal truth. At least 90% of your so-called \"avant garde\" art are actually dug out from the ancient heaps known as Terran history.\nLa Fantoma got a new rapper brand? After viewing ten live recordings from the most classic Obsidian Festivals at Siesta, these so-called neo-rappers got NOTHING on the giant known to us as \"Emperor\"! They made ZERO innovations on the beats, rhyme, and rhythm. [LINK NO LONGER VALID] \nHundred-Strong Graffiti of the Asphalt Roundabout? From what I unearthed, these giant graffiti were past-tense in the Ursus factories of Terra. The Infected crew were already creating mega-graffiti at their barracks and production floors. [ATTACHMENT NOT FOUND]\nNeo-Youth Film Festival of New Wrankwood? Hah. That's an even bigger joke. The Talosian free city can't even come up with their own name and just took something from the Terran city of Wrankwood.\nSo where the hell can we find true avant garde art of Talos-II?\nIf you want novelty and innovation, I'll tell you what it means to be truly avant garde.\nI've unearthed a video about the Endfield Protocol-Originium Technology (Protorig Tech). [Author has set the video to pay per view]\nMany might be confused about the Protorig Tech I mentioned. But you know that art cannot be fully detached from industrial tech. Derivative works of aesthetics based on Terran technology will end up like those sorry examples I listed above. We will never free ourselves from the label of Terran culture!\nBut Protorig Tech is the most \"avant garde\" and \"coolest\" innovation that happens to be Talos-exclusive, isn't it? It completely shattered our understanding of spatial dimensions, but why haven't I seen any artist using them as a fount for artistic creation?\nAvant garde isn't about going through your trash or pasting new labels on old antiques.\nSo if you're fumbling around with stuff that your grandparents had fun with, STAAHHHP calling yourself \"avant garde\".\n\nDISCLAIMER: Views expressed in this article are personal and do not reflect our official stance.

      "en": "I raised my handcannon three times in my life.\nWhen I raised a handcannon for the first time, I thought I had the entire world in my hands.\nI had a fight with my old man. I didn't want to study in a UWST med school for a cushy future. I hid in my bed and secretly binged on videos with my handyterm, things that my father never allowed me to watch: Iberian Inquisitors and invincible Laterano Gun-Knights with weapons raised. I emulated the figures in the handyterm and fumbled with the old man's big iron. I imagined the Arts coursing from my fingertips into the Originium circuitry within the weapon, propelling the non-existent etched ammo to create a non-existent hole in the wall.\n......\nWhen I raised a handcannon for the second time, I thought it was my last.\nI departed from Valley IV to perform a field medical rescue operation at a nearby village. While the operation was underway, we were set upon by a vicious band of Landbreakers. We could only panic at that time. None of us expected to see LBs so close to Valley IV.\nI activated the Originium comms and tried calling the Valley Fort for assistance. As the LB howling got louder and louder, I tweaked the frequency knob faster and faster. But all I got was static and noise. I raised my handcannon and squeezed the trigger blindly. Then I led the children and made for the Valley Fort at the distant horizon as fast as our legs could carry us.\n......\nI could not remember how long we ran upon the wildlands, but the day grew late. The pursuing LBs were long gone but I dared not lead the children back to their village. Who knows, there could be a trap waiting for us. I had already taken a few hits from crossbow bolts and my vision began to blur and swim. I could no longer make up the shape of the Fort, and could only trudge onwards as I struggled to recall what I saw during the ride to this place.\n......\nI collapsed, exhausted, and my body instinctively curled up. The children were trying as they tried to shake me awake. I told myself to keep my eyes open but my eyelids won the struggle. When I woke up the following day, I found myself lying in a Dusthair camp far from Valley IV. It was only then when I knew that we took off in the wrong direction, and it was the crying of the children that brought the Dusthair surgeon to my aid.\nThe experience taught me how powerless I was, and I would be better off pursuing a career in general practice and inherit the family clinic. I made up my mind to submit my resignation once my body recovered.\n......\nWhen I raised my handcannon for the third time, it was over a medal.\nI saw my schooling days in a dream. My father, stern-faced as usual, listened to my med school instructors' complaints about my oddness and peculiarities. The old man later went to my dorms. He did not confiscate my handyterm, but sat down and watched the videos with me. It was at that time when I saw him take out a medal that he never wore from a chest pocket.\nI dreamed some more. It felt as though I arrived upon the Land shown in the videos. I ran across the plains with a handcannon. That medal turned into a bullet and I fired it into the sky.\nThat was when I woke. My entire strength seemed to had been sapped away by this dream.\nI was sweating profusely upon the sickbed. I heard cries of surprise, shock, and terror. This time it wasn't just the LBs. There were Ankhors as well.\nI took out the handcannon from under my pillow. My father gifted it to me when he learned I joined Endfield Industries.\nIt was this very moment that I knew I would keep raising this handcannon for the fourth, fifth, or even the sixth time..."

      "en": "I know who you are. I know where you came from.\nYou were one of them. You must be. I see the forge fire in your eyes. You stood vigils over the smelting furnaces for years.\nYou came to the south because you could no longer face the Aggeloid nightmares. But you feared of being called a deserter. That was why you changed your name and joined us as an arsenal engineer. You found this simpler life at Endfield worth living. You helped fellow Endfielders survive their battles. They were grateful and praised the weapons you designed. Your work was balanced and operated smoothly. Your designs incorporated years of actual combat experience. You read Endfield science and research and it probably made you think about things. If the Fort had these technologies, you might have stayed at that place.\nDespite your reputation as a cranky old man, the girl likes you a lot. You always had a story to tell, stories that her parents never talked about. Stories about heroes, how they lived, how they fought without a care of their lives, and how their sacrifices went unsung and unremembered. You even learned a thing or two from her, right? This seamless design feature ... would be an oddity at the place where you once served.\nThis was why you hesitated when the girl asked you to teach her how to swing a sword. At first, you thought of your dashing, youthful years. Fencing skills would help the girl better protect herself. But your mind changed. The girl had the entire Endfield arsenal as well as loving parents to support her. She did not need to know about fencing. You then convinced yourself that the girl needed no instructions from a deserter and ex-butcher who broke his oaths. The old road had been abandoned for years. No one should take it anymore. It calls for no one, and needs none.\nThus, you applied for divisional transfer. You wanted to leave the arsenal and force yourself back to field service — you believe you should be able to stomach the frontlines of Endfield Industries.\nPlease do not look at me like I'm some sort of a Sarkaz Djall mind-floggers. And no. I wasn't using any mind-reading instruments.\nI do have a message for you: Supervisor Perlica will not oppose any decision you make, but please, don't make the girl sad."

      "en": "It was late at night. You saw smoke billowing from the next door workshop. The ringing of hammer striking the anvil could be heard within a three block radius. It was deliberate. It was loud.\n\"What is she trying to prove?\" you didn't want to care, but suddenly remembered the maniac next door mumbling about the near-completion of her work. Thus, you turned around and headed next door while putting on your jacket, all the while mumbling this to yourself, \"Talos forbid if she actually forges it.\"\nGlowing embers floated through the gap of the workshop door. You now regret putting on the jacket as the place was terrifyingly hot. The light of the fire also lured in the tramp who lived three blocks away. She wore something cooler, and started scoffing at you right from the get-go.\n\"Idiot. Look at you, all bundled up. When was the last time you lit your smithy's furnace?\" The tramp always talked like this since she could crawl. She envenomed her weapons with her spit.\nYou ignored her and pushed open the door. The entire house was awash by the fiery glow of the forge. The maniac stood besides it, and unleashed a hysterical riot of a laughter when she saw you two enter her workshop.\n\"You're too late! I shall be the one giving life to this weapon!\" The maniac was wholly drenched in sweat. You saw only fanatical zealotry on her face.\nThe tramp got closer to the forge and studied the roiling hot ferrium. Her tone turned somber as she delivered these words: \"This is bad. She's going to forge it.\"\nEnvy surged from your guts. You felt like vomiting.\nYou hated each other's guts, but the three of you were once the best of friends. You forgot how the hate actually started, or you grew up together. Even all those evenings you spent drinking together escaped your memories. The only thing you recalled was that prophecy spreading throughout Seš'qa: \"A legendary weapon shall be born this winter. And only three smiths could hope to achieve this feat.\" As luck (or misfortune) would have it, the three of you happen to be the best smiths of the city.\nSince then, all three of you became obsessed with forging the legendary weapon before the other two. Every meeting became a scheme and an attempt to beat the other senseless and throw them out of the city.\nBoth you and the tramp had nothing to say at this moment. A skilled smith need only look at the fire to know the immense power it held. The maniac worked the bellows to raise the furnace temperature, but try as she might, the furnace refused to get any hotter. She sighed and wiped away the sweat from her face.\nThe tramp's face darkened as she gloated: \"You are going to fail.\"\nThe maniac, however, did not even bat an eye at you. She simply laughed: \"Far from it!\" And with that, she slit open her throat. Hot blood gushed out like lava and flowed into the furnace.\nYou and the tramp stretched out your hands together but it was too late. The maniac fell into the furnace and a deafening explosion echoed throughout the town. Fire spluttered out of the furnace chamber and spread throughout the entire workshop. The flames roared with greater fury and threatened to end the night itself. Even the skies feared what was about to happen, and desperately unloaded a great snow to put out the fire.\nAs the temperature continued its rapid rise, you looked at the tramp for a word. But decades of tacit understanding tell you that nothing needed to be said.\nYou approached the fire, ignored the painful burns, and worked the bellows once more. The nascent weapon within the forge hummed and complained. It was not hot enough. The temperature is too low. It demanded a flame with enough heat to sear a hole through the skies. The tramp sneered as you saw the blaze dancing in her eyes, a conflagration of fury, pain, regret, and ambition. Fire burst from her eyes and swallowed her whole. You had no time to grieve for the snowstorm of the night was relentless. It would do anything to put out their fires.\nYou were the idiot of the group who never mastered the Arts. The only recourse you had was better and more precise controls over the bellows for firing up the heat. Years of experience made you a master of keeping the fire going. The bellows swelled and emptied as the fire danced and howled. The flaming tongues licked your skin and it slowly gave way like molten wax. But the mere thought of the weapon maturing into its form gave you incredible elation and made you beam with satisfaction.\nDid it hurt? It was far less painful than the last fight you had when the maniac tore a piece off your face with her teeth.\nBefore the flames completely devoured you, you finally remembered how they laughed with merriment back in the tavern.\nThe flames might not endure against the night-long blizzard, and there would be no trace of the three of you after the workshop fire. Nevertheless, you knew that a fireplace would remain, and within it they would find a sword capable of cleaving anything in the world apart."

His unwavering gaze stared at the north.\n\"You never expected to be defeated, right?\" Jerreth coughed and spat. He wiped the bloody bubbles of spit from his lips with a muddied sleeve and approached the huge figure. The shattered remains of dead Aggeloi surrounded him.\nJerreth picked up the man's broken weapon and tossed it aside to make room for a seat.\n\"We were heading south. WE WERE HEADING TOWARDS THE BLASTED SOUTH! Nobody knew we were going south until we started down the road!\"\nJerreth toyed with the pen in his hand. Without ink, it was little more than an empty tube.\n\"I ... I don't know what to write... How should I report this? Gah... I should get the hell out of this place.\"\nThe supplies on the trailer truck were completely destroyed. One of the ropes for securing the cargo crates dangled next to Jerreth. \n\"You should have been the one who survived... You're the hero of the army... You were the only one who could see this through... the only one...\"\n\"I'm just a journalist! How would I write about this crushing defeat? They'll murder my career for robbing the glory of this magnificent battle!\"\nJerreth buried his face in his hands and howled in agony. He did not stop shaking since the fight began.\nAfter quite a while, he finally stood up and felt the northern breeze brushing against him.\n\"There was this story. The hero's name was finally recited in an epic paean, his deeds glorified and enshrined by the lines. There is no such thing as a silent and ignominious death.\"\n\n\"I'm going home.\"\nHe mumbled to himself as he cast everything aside. He threw away his memories, career, and responsibilities at this very site right next to the suit of heavy armor.\n\"I'm going home...\"\nAnd thus he left a trail of footprints as he trudged towards a certain direction. He was indeed going home."

      "en": "Somewhere in the wildlands, a convoy of heavy caravans switched off their engines and parked before the roadblock. The wind-stirred dust raked against the windows as the dull booms of explosions and things hitting the ground reverberated.\nA young trucker lowered the window and poked his head out. \"Blasted weather. Looks like it's gonna rain again! And do we have more buggerloids up ahead? This is our third encounter this month!\"\nAn older trucker got out of the cab. The Originium device of his caravan was already attempting to clean the windshield of the dust. \"The redistribution post has dispatched an emergency team. See that engineering vehicle? The crew is already clearing the rubble off the road.\"\n\"Eh, mate. You look like a real veteran. Seen any special buggers?\" the young trucker asked curiously.\nThe old man lit a cigarette: \"Saw one at a nearby outpost ten years ago. Blasted buggerloid was bigger than a caravan. I also witnessed a fellow trucker scampering into the cab.\"\n\"Did he make it?\"\n\"Well, that oversized bugger followed but couldn't hold its grip. Rolled off with the caravan container and got crushed by fifty tons of raw Originium ore.\"\n\"Sounds like a really stupid bugger. Man, that trucker got super lucky. People told me there were rocky-crawlies all over this place back then.\"\n\"It was way worse back then,\" the old trucker blew a smoke ring into the air. \"This highway didn't exist, and there were no RD posts nor support teams from the TGCC. It was a time when local town and villages, no matter the size, would fight each other or breakers over tinned provisions.\"\nThat got the young trucker interested. Half of his body was almost out of his cab. \"Fighting breaker clans over a few tins? Dayyum. All I see are just crafters selling their wares and stuff nowadays. I even see people from Kjersch.\"\n\"That was how we founded the Chamber of Commerce. The entire venture started with a dozen or so very experienced truckers. My mentor was amongst the Chamber Founders,\" the old trucker smiled. \"See that Endfield installation? It ran out of food ten years ago. We took the risk, forced our way through breaker turf, and delivered the food. That was my first time behind a caravan wheel.\"\n\"I bet they were super grateful about the food.\"\n\"Not really. They mopped the floor with a band of breakers who tried to raid them. The Endfielders looted the breakers' rations and that kept them going for a while.\"\n\nThe sound of explosions got closer and the rubble began cascading off the slopes of the hill in the far distance. The truckers waited patiently for passage.\n\"The RD post kept talking about ... 'business conformance',\" the young trucker got back into his cab and took out a huge bar of chocolate. He tore off a piece and threw it at another trucker who waited by his caravan. \"Route reviews are okay, just a tiny waste of time. But now they're even slapping a uniform price on Origo-fueling, and the price is friggin' ex. These guys are siphoning our T-Creds.\"\nAnother trucker taking a walk overheard the conversation and decided to join in. \"Say what you want, but things would be so much better if we didn't have to pay TGCC its cut.\"\n\"Then who's gonna mint the T-Creds? Who's gonna take care of freelancing truckers like us?\" the veteran trucker smiled as he puffed another smoke ring.\n\"Oh?\"\n\"And forget about that Extra Crispy Drumsticks from Caravan Express, or decently priced fueling stops when the TGCC disappears.\"\n\"I...,\" the young trucker was at a loss of words. He finally shook his hands and returned to his cabin. \"Meh. He can't even take a joke about the cartel.\"\n\nThey heard another explosion, this time closer than before.\n\"The TGCC is all about big business nowadays...\" the trucker added after his momentary hesitation. \"Heard about some company trying to monopolize Origo-fuel supplies...\"\nThe veteran trucker looked at the smoke in the distance.\n\"Monopolies... The last one who ignored the Accord and tried to do that got a generous serving of jail time, courtesy of the TGCC joint session. Speaking of which, trading of key resources will always be controlled, but they're doing it for the Northern Front. I made plenty of deliveries to that place. Those trips were really hairy.\"\n\"Oh, the North, right? I actually squished a buggerloid with my truck.\"\n\nA few workers at the front of the caravan suddenly carried the roadblock away. A raspy noise blared out of the Originium radios: \"Road section cleared. Roll along and keep your distance.\"\n\"You're going to Valley IV, right? I guess this is where we part ways,\" the young trucker roared as loud as he could.\n\"Are you tired of me already? I'm heading to Wuling too!\" the old trucker strapped into his seat and checked his rearview mirror. \"We're far from parting ways.\"\n\"Da hell, old boy? Are you following me or something?\"\n\"You take me as a stalker? I'm gonna load up on food at Wuling, drop them at Valley IV, get some Originium ore for Kjersch, and then haul a container full of craftwork to La Fantoma.\"\nThe truckers continued their crude banter, started their engines, and got back into the never-ending caravans."

      "en": "Fuyao:\nMama dreamed of you last night again. By this time, you should be back at Baizao with your Dada and having fun together with your grandparents. The streets should be filled with the smells of delicious feasts for New Year's Eve. Had your dumplings yet? Hope your Dada didn't make them this time. He never learned how to make them proper — He never rested his dough properly, and his wrappings were either too thick or too thin. If he insisted, just pray he wouldn't mess up again. I remember that time when you were one year old. He hid a coin in the dumplings and you accidentally choked on it. Your entire face turned blue and I was panicking beyond words. Thankfully the old Tianshi visited us at just the right time and saved your life.\nAlas, the mobile container-home where we once ate dumplings together got smashed by an Ankhor. Everything got drilled straight into the earth, including those crooked couplets. Mama is now escorting the crew of the pioneering base southwards. Thank goodness your father is now off duty so I got him to bring you home to the rest of the family... Otherwise you'd be on this terrible road with me, crying non-stop from the cold and hunger. The monstrosities they call \"Aggeloi\" are merciless and cruel. But don't you worry, your Mama's a master in the School of Thunder.\nFor tonight, we found shelter in a valley. A farmer lady made a new year rice cake soup with the food we had left and doled it out to everyone. Mama also snipped out a few window flowers and pasted them on our temporary shelter. There are workers singing a chorus with their coarse yet passionate Ursine and Victorian accents. Mama certainly did not expect to be separated from you and Dada for our second New Year Festival in Talos-II.\nMama misses you. And if you miss Mama, just squeeze the doll I tucked in your wrappings. Mama made it, you know. I can totally feel your tender squishes, no matter the number of stars that separate us.\nSincerely, Mama\n\nFuyao:\nYou're about to go to school, right? Mama wonders how tall you are right now. Who do you look like more? Mama or Dada? How goes your lessons? I'm sorry I couldn't be at your side and help you with your homework. Though your Dada graduated from the Academy, he could never figure out mathematics. I hope he doesn't slow you down. Speaking of which, what is your favorite subject right now?\nSo, do you know the origins of your name, Fuyao? Mama and Dada came to Talos-II because we love the cosmos. You were born right under the Cosmic Gate. We thought you might just become a Tianshi of spaceflight and thus named you Fuyao, the rapid essence. But names are just a dream. Mama's actual wish is to see you grow up in peace. I don't care if you like reading or enjoy doing other things. Mama will always support your choice.\nTimes are difficult in this war we are fighting. Not too long ago my mentor paid a visit and asked me to join a project on building a great vessel to orbit around Talos-II. We're not the only one. The team includes many Terrans stranded at this place... Everyone generously provided all the secret tech, artifacts, and wonders they have. Many of these are unique technological marvels that could never be recreated, but they willingly staked everything for the sake of victory.\nMama is now part of the project, but I'm just responsible for the design and construction of a small support module. I never thought I could reach for the stars with my own strength so quickly. Then again, Mama also felt I've been waiting for this moment for far too long.\nAfter all, we've spent too many days suffering upon this planet, and I missed too many moments of you growing up.\nSincerely, Mama\n\nFuyao:\nThe war has ended. But I can't but feel bitter about what happened after our \"victory\". We could no longer return to Terra. Every road home has been permanently closed. We failed to make any progress. Not only that, we almost annihilated ourselves in the internecine conflicts that followed.\nMama dreamed of you again. I saw you all grown up and becoming an accomplished Tianshi with a Tianshi apparatus in hand. But when I woke, I realized I could hardly remember how you looked like in the dream. We haven't met for so many years. Do you still remember how Mama looked like? You probably won't recognize Mama right now since Mama's not that young anymore. Hongshan is a massive crater, and it has been granted to the Tianshi who stayed in Talos-II. There are many compatriots from Yan here. Together, we built the Hongshan Academy of Sciences and started growing crops at this place. Mama shared the techniques and knowledge of hydroponics that I prepared for the space-faring tech demo. It took us several years but we finally received a bountiful harvest. Plenty of people can finally stop worrying about starving when the next batch of seeds are ready.\nOnce our granaries are full and our people clothed, I hope we can once again cast our eyes upon the celestial heights. Though the Cosmic Gate is beyond our reach, Mama shall take a great ship, ride the uplifting Fuyao vortex, sail through the stars, and reunite with you.\nPlease wait for that day, my dearest darling child.\nSincerely, Mama"

      "en": "\"Well. Killed that young apprentice of mine, didn't you? Why?\"\n\"Oh... Ooooh... That was your apprentice? Ugh. It's all a misunderstanding. This is how it happened... The fine young lad came to our underground arena and won ten fights in a row. He probably wanted to earn his moment of fame with our event. Unfortunately, we're a for-profit organization, so we ... not me of course, sent a couple of mediators to have a talk with him. It was supposed to be a nice conversation. But, ugh... No one expected the accident to happen...\"\n\"Nonsense.\"\n\"Then ... I guess you're free to correct us?\"\n\"You weren't worried about the unexpected accident. You just didn't expect for the master himself to show up in your face... And quit acting all civilized and polite. It disgusts me.\"\n\"That'd rather dull, wouldn't you say, sir?\"\n\"Rather dull? Perhaps I'll tell how you about the story of the Asphalt Roundabout.\"\n\"I'm all ears.\"\n\"When it first started, nobody thought the Roundabout would end up like this. It began as a hostel for road construction crews. Then long-haul truckers started housing their families here as well. The roads and freight routes natural transport hub and all sorts of people started filling up the place. That was when all these underground tourneys and matches started. The Roundabout was also the place where you could buy all sorts of weapons, gear, and even luxury goods. At its heyday, the Roundabout was the center of it all ... money, ambitions, and muscle... Of course, everyone respected the bottom line.\n\"I was amongst the founding road construction crew. I saw this patch of cargo-homes grow and attain a size equal to that of a free city. The sight made me a happy man. I felt the Roundabout was leagues ahead of that Talos City that they could never complete. Sometimes I'd even think that I'm a little too obsessed about 'collective glory'. Perhaps a transfer to the United Workers might have done me good. Do you understand what I'm saying?\"\n\"Oh yes, I do. Very much so.\"\n\"No, sod. Look at yourself. I don't think you're the type who understand what glory means. You only care about shallow decency. I won't blame you. The Roundabout is now filled with your kind of people... like Half-Face and Signor Tommasino... Good people left when we stopped building the roads and the place was no longer a center of infrastructure projects. And then others moved in. Your kind of people, the type who respected no rules nor bottom lines. You turned the Roundabout into a cesspit...\"\n\"A quite intriguing tale, sir. When I decided to bring the lads to the Roundabout to make a living, I actually investigated this place in a most meticulous manner. I acquired a legal license to operate from Mieszko Industries and paid respectable visits to every local organization. I believe I have conducted every step in perfect fashion to ensure the survival of our little setup. In all honesty, I do intend to extricate myself from a questionable past and start an honest business. Likewise, my organization adheres strongly to the rules... But why did you make it sound like I'm the one breaking the rules? Shouldn't it be that hard-headed apprentice of yours?\"\n\"Rules? There is only but one rule. Treat yourself *AND* others as fellow humans... This is the one rule that your kind will never figure out.\"\n\"Huh. I'd never heard of it before. Did you just make it up?\" \n\"No, son. I wrote the rule and I've fought long and hard to defend it.\"\n\"I think I understand now. You're one of those 'Masked Heroes\"... Hah! I thought people like you only existed in children's books... Truth be told, I aspired to be someone like you when I was a boy. There were times when I pondered what would I be like if I were born a century or so earlier. Could I become one of the heroes who ended the First Aggeloi War? That aside, things are very different now, old sir. The time for heroes is long gone. We must use other means to achieve eminent repute.\"\n\"Hur. I'm no hero. Just an old fool who fights only when I'm completely out of patience. Yet despicable scum like you who'd do anything to win are far worse.\"\n\"Well said, sir. Perhaps we should let our weapons do the talking from now on.\""

      "en": "She began to think why she was selected for this mission.\nIt was because of her mastery of the cryogenic Arts and adaptation to the icefields, but more importantly, it was her wildlands pathfinding skills. It was intuitive to her. She could read the stars in the night skies and use them as guiding beacons. The Order of Steel Oath was only founded barely a year ago. She was the best candidate for a scout and someone capable of re-establishing a link between the severed civilizations.\nShe understood her mission and set off with that hard drive.\nThe hard drive contained all the data that the Order of Steel Oath collected over the year about the North, their enemies, and their allies. The fearless souls once stepped out of the group and assembled in a separate formation. They recited their steel hard oaths and left Civilization to head into the North, back into the devastated fields of war. There they used themselves as lures to divert Aggeloid offensives... Many people treated their departure as a sign — A sign for the impending disintegration of Civilization. The pessimists believed that once Civilization began mobilizing people to sacrifice themselves, it would inevitably continue to check certain groups people for the grinder... These self-sacrificing individuals, whom we now call the Oathkeepers, were aware of this. Hence, they must re-connect the Civilizations. The information earned with their lives must become a navigational star to light the way ahead.\nAnd now this small, nascent \"star\" rested in the courier's backpack. She panted heavily with every step through the cold air and snow.\nBlood coursed down her arms and dripped all over the ground. Her left arm and left leg were almost completely shattered. She felt every white, hot jolt of pain as bits of bone grated against the soft tissue. Her wounds were inflicted by a new Aggeloid that was never catalogued. The courier thought about the gates of the fort... Perhaps the abomination was created as a siege weapon.\nRandom thoughts surged through her mind. When the Oathkeepers first marched North, they encountered uncatalogued Aggeloi nearly everyday. It would seem that they were beset by an interrogator more than eager to showcase his repertoire of torture devices. Aggeloi designed to kill and massacre with ever-increasing efficacy started to appear throughout the battlefield. Defeating this host will be costly — It will require uncountable lives hellbent on a relentless march...\n\"Defeating the host... That's right...\"\nThe courier suddenly remembered that she was still alive. She, not the Aggelos, was the victor of that battle... She was the one that froze that long, heavy, and rampaging agglomeration of rock ... and shattered it to pieces... Its fragments glittered in the sunlight like the stars themselves.\nOther thoughts began to surface.\n\"The stars can guide my way. Mom and Dad taught me that they could guide travelers in the wildlands... No... We are the stars themselves... I must tell them that we stood our ground in the far North where it is colder than death... They will hear this ... and ignite the embers of hope...\"\nMore of her blood flowed and seeped into the permafrost.\n\"But where is the star? Is it in my hands?\n\"Where am I?\n\"I cannot see it. The night looms before my eyes, but why ... why won't any of the stars glitter for me?\"\n......\n\"It's because the old stars have faded away, but the new stars have yet to be born...\"\nShe tried to raise her hand as high as she could... Her Arts caused the ice to sprout from the bloodsoaked earth beneath her, creep up her body, smother her face, course across the length of her arm, and reach skywards. Its tip was directed towards safety.\n\"Go higher, and higher still... Be the nova that points the way.\" Her final thought was crystallized. All that was left was the nascent star wholly forged of frigid ice.\n......\nShe would not know that after many weeks, other couriers followed her guide and reached further south. Their journey ended at the edge of the permafrost. More followed, singers of painful hannas, travelers who need to cross the fields of war...\nThe little \"nova\" was handed to many people. In its final destination, the great vessel named Dijiang used it to light the northern skies."

Beneath the heavy gray skies, snowflakes fell as bone-chilling winds howled across the plains, unchallenged by the wilting grass as it burrowed into an old, leaking observation post... There the winds were briefly checked by a campfire before they stopped by a young man's cheek.\n\"ACHOO!\"\nThe sneezing did not slow the young Perro speed in stuffing two slabs of bread and a meat stew into his mouth. He even wanted to lick the plate if he could.\n\"Oh... Thanks a lot for this...\"\n\"You're welcome. The cold drove us to this campfire. We're friends now.\"\nThe grinning Forte \"chef\" sat by the campfire and gazed at him. He looked around thirty or so.\n\"So, friend, why venture to the North alone?\"\n\"I'm trying to visit the masters of the fighting arts and complete my Catalog of Warriors Under the Heavens! Oh, that's just a book with the backstories of every warrior... We have this legendary master named Chen Chichi of Hongshan but nobody knew where she went. I thought I could visit the North and find out... But as luck would have it, the Aggeloi was the one that chased me all the way here. Dammit, I bet we'd be getting another Ankhorfall soon enough.\"\nThe Forte helped himself to a ladle of the stew.\n\"I know this one. Orphaned at a young age and got admitted to Tanjian Hall where she became the worst disciple of the cohort. But after doing her Jianghu tours, she became a legend amongst those of her generation and a lauded master of swordmancy... Even got herself a happy family. Husband's quite the master in leapmancy. They also have a daughter. Name's Chen Qianyu, I think.\"\n\"That's so detailed. Are you a swordmancer as well?\"\n\"I learned a few swordmancy moves from the wildlands from a Songseeker.\"\n\"So, what do you think about Master Chen Chichi?\"\n\"An great and imposing mountain.\"\n\"Yeah... She's the dream of every swordmancer. They say her swordmancy is imbued with a state of unrestrained freedom. It's more than being faster than a comet. Those who witnessed her sword singing across the skies could feel the 'heavens and earth' itself. It felt as though everything in this world, from the tallest peaks to the deepest seas, has achieved oneness with her blade. Her sword itself is light and elegant. It's like a speck of dust and a gust of wind. It strikes with a force contained within every existence... I can hardly imagine anything that could withstand her blade. Not even the Aggelos...\"\n\"Ankhor.\"\n\"Indeed. Her sword can probably cleave the largest Ankhors in two...\"\n\"I'm saying we have an Ankhorfall.\"\nThe young Perro instantly leaped up without raising his head, jumped over the campfire, and bounded for the outside.\n\"You can't outrun an Ankhor.\"\n\"Well, at least I won't be crushed by it. I'll take my luck outrunning its Aggeloid spawn.\"\n\"Haha. That'd be quite a challenge. We lost that race years ago.\"\nThe Forte strolled out casually and slowly.\n\"When I was a lad, I herded stockbeasts for a Songseeker. We were surrounded by the Aggeloi when a swordmancer drew her iron blade and unleashed a crimson cleave that pulverized the rock buggers. A master leapmancer then grabbed me with his arms and helped me escape the encirclement... I spent years traveling and paid more than a few visits to Hongshan, but my search has found nothing. I have nothing but respect for this couple...\"\nThe Forte then drew sword swords from his hip scabbards.\n\"I may not achieve their levels of mastery, but such is my goal. I spent years honing my swordmancy and managed to replicate a fraction of that overwhelming cleave I have witnessed. This is one auspicious day. May you witness my achievement.\"\nThe Ankhor smote the ground and turned their former shelter to a pile of rubble.\nWhat followed was a flurry of glinting blades."

      "en": "As the great guns thundered into the skies, night finally returned to Fort Forgefane. The steam stopped hissing as the last Aggelos was crushed into gravel. Victory trumpeted throughout the icefields, the clarion call of triumph echoed amongst collapsed bastions before it reached a stone crypt used as a provisional morgue to house the fallen warriors.\nTo the smiths of Fort Forgefane, the clarion call felt more like a final farewell to the soldier. A forgesmith pulled a cart of salvaged equipment and paused before a young Oathkeeper, long bereft of breath.\nWhy did the smith stop? Was it his fear of death? He did not think so. He dreamed about falling like a true Oathkeeper soldier from the day he submitted his enlisting papers to the Order of Steel Oath. And since his first arrival at the gates of Fort Forgefane, he was determined to be a nail, permanently hammered into his post. There were only two things that could stop him from swinging his hammer: the future he dreamed had been achieved, or it became necessary for someone else to take his post.\nThe smith stooped over and took the long sword from the hands of the young soldier.\nHe could not remove his gaze from the soldier's face. Was he paying his final respects to a former comrade? No. He had said his farewells to all sorts of people in the south before he marched for the north. He saw his loved ones secretly weeping for his sake, witnessed the reluctance in their eyes, and even attended a close friend's funeral on the night before he reported to the training camp.\nBut what he felt at this very moment was new. A mysterious surge of emotions gripped him to the ground, even though he tried, again and again, to get himself to leave.\nHeavy footsteps echoed in the crypt. The smith raised his head and held his breath.\n\"Lord Castellan Gerald! Apologies, I'm just ... salvaging the equipment.\"\nThe armored giant stretched out his hand and took the blade from the smith. The edge was curled and a fine crack ran along its length.\n\"Do you know him?\"\n\"No... We're not familiar. But I did share some drink with him in the welcoming feast held for us several days ago...\"\n\"What do you intend to do with this blade?\"\nThe smith took the blade and shook off the snow from the hilt. He carefully studied the wounds suffered by the weapon and gave his verdict: \"It will be my honor to return this blade to the furnace and have it recast, and the joy will be equal to seeing you throw this Aggeloid host back to whence they came. He is a hero ... that no one will remember.\"\n\"He is also a common man, just as common as this blade.\"\n\"My Lord Castellan... what would you have me do to this blade?\"\n\"Even the perfect blade will one day shatter,\" Gerald patted the smith on the shoulder. \"It shall be returned to the forge, pass through the ranks of Oathkeepers, and fulfill his unfinished duty.\""

Coexistence with Talos-II was not cowardice, and one did not dispense with vigor and braveness when helping the needy. The melodies of the hanna began with the most primal and intense of sufferings. When the entire world choruses with the hanna, no one would be left behind.\n...And thus Orisha pulled out a knife from one of the twelve bodies and asks the Sandreaver her final questions.\n\"From whence did they come, marks made ten thousand years ago?\n\"And where will they go, stars that shimmer in the heavens above?\n\"Why do they stop, bedazzling colors that soak the lands and the soil?\n\"How can they claim wisdom, when they stare blankly at nature's trove?\n\"Did they truly choose to fight never-ending battles and wars?\n\"Are they courageous by raising weapons against those who held naught?\n\"How can a clan unite if they only raid but never protect nor grow?\n\"How can a people survive if they ignore change and pursue the feuds of old?\"\n\nThe Sandreaver, drunk on violence, had no answer.

      "en": "...Let me get this straight. Your team lost to Z7 in the combat drill 'cause you didn't graduate from a military school and Lil' Dodge wasn't your instructor?\nEnough excuses, kid. I trained tons of raw recruits like you and I totally lost count on the number of losers who hamstring themselves by boo-hooing about their sad backstories.\nLook at your face! Do you think I'm gonna give you a motivational story how a missing degree or diploma isn't that important? HAH! WRONG! I'm your friggin' instructor, not your pathetic shrink! I'm not going to make you feel good about your academic failures!\nSince we mentioned degrees, then I gotta say — it's actually pretty important.\nBut if you're missing one, there are solutions to go about it.\n\nI became an instructor after all. Guess how I did it?\nWRONG AGAIN! I, Sato Kogo, never read a proper book in my life. In fact, I only learned how to write in Victorian thanks to courses offered aboard Dijiang. When I was your age, I was just a bummed out debt collector in Neo Tsukushi!\nWha? Don't you know what a debt collector is...? Ugh. Forget it. I'll put it simply. Hired muscle. That was my job.\nSo did that for about three or four years. I was either bruising people or getting bruised myself. As long as someone paid the creds, it didn't really matter to me.\n\nI was in my twenties and I thought I'd be doing that for the rest of my life... I never expected something big to happen.\nOh yes... Stepped on a few toes. The wrong tail, actually. Not some cartel security firm, but an actual big shot oyabun.\nUgh. This is exactly why I kept telling you to pay attention to the surroundings when you fight. I learned it the very hard way, so at least take this from me.\n\nWeather was great that day. I besieged that gambling den with two dozen bros from the organization. There were just around eight people on the other side and I thought it would be a cakewalk.\nBut those dudes fought like beasts in heat. Half of the lads were down in a heartbeat. I was out of ideas but I couldn't just leave my bros behind. So I came up with the clever idea of using the revolving doors...\nHow did I do it? Well, i simply undid the security latch and got it spinning... Anyways, I got two enemies down in an instant. Some of the bros started helping and we sent the rest of them packing.\nThere was one thing I miscalculated. The revolving door was connected to the one upstairs. Now that wouldn't sound like a thing but my boss suddenly got the bright idea of enjoying the spectacle. Suffice to say, his tail got caught — Boss man was also a Lupo and you know what they do when somebody messes with their tail.\nWhat happened next? Geesh. Do I have to spell it out? I escaped to the frontiers before they gave me cement shoes! I slogged two years in trucking, four in janitorial work, and three in bounty hunting. My liver was dying on me and luck finally turned when I arrived at Endfield — Some old client wrote me a recommendation. Thank the Big Gas for that.\n\nAlright. Your turn. Tell me about your plans on beating Z7 next time?"

That was why he came to this place to release himself. Of course, that release inevitably evolved into self-pity and many bottles of kohl.\nThe thirteenth empty bottle flew and fell into the sea.\nSo why did he feel so terrible? Was there something that he could not put to rest? Medals? He threw them away. His preferred weapon? He couldn't even remember where he buried it. \"Oh... Yes, there is indeed something else.\"\nHe took off his eye patch, then scooped out the thing that never warmed from his socket. The prosthetic eye of gold and Origocrust stared at him from his palm.

His ancestors strode the fields in the Battle of the Four Emperors and witnessed the fall of Gaul... It did not matter if they became powerful magnates or explorers of Terra. The eye was always handed down to the next in line. He, the disgraced failure, was the last inheritor.\nThe glory of his house shone through the pupil hemmed by golden filigree, and it cast a spine-chilling glare into his soul.\nHe clenched his fist and closed his fingers around the heirloom of an unbroken line, then cast it into the sea without hesitation.\n\"There. It is done. All clean and quiet.\"\nThe kohl within him swirled and made him burp. That ring in the far distance looked more and more like a well. He remembered the wishing well he saw in a small village he chanced upon during his Grand Tour of Terra. People threw coins of gold and silver into the well and prayed for their wishes to come true. The price of the item cast into the well would determine the scope of the wish manifested.\n\"Hurhur. Bunch of fools.\"\nIf that were true, what about the thing he just threw into that well? What wish could it hope to accomplish?\nThe eye was a prized treasure that witnessed the fall of great nations, transforming civilizations, carnage, rebirth, destruction, and perseverance. Would the well mold it into something else?\n\"Forget it. I'd rather sleep this off.\"\nHe raised his hand and launched the fourteenth bottle into the air, and followed its trail until it was held in stasis in mid-air.\nThe wishing well had granted its response.\n\nA complete silence was followed by the emergence of an enormous crystal formation.\nThe heavens were rent asunder and revealed a path of Originium.\nCountless figures of grand majesty stood amongst the clouds by the end of this long road. A massive Cosmic Gate appeared behind them.\n\"Why, Your Majesties? Why?\n\"Is it because I have cast away your gift? Because I abandoned my history, my lineage, and all my glories?\"\nHis fallen comrades sprouted from the Originium road. They stretched out their withered limbs and shattered weapons, and did all they could to make him stay.\nSo he took out a spear.\nEvery carcass he pierced revealed a great many words. He bowed his head to read these weighty words and revealed them to be names.\nHe saw the names of his father, his grandfather, the pasha, the pope, the inquisitor, the frontiersmate, the miner...\nHe followed the River of the Dead and walked past the historical figures.\nFinally, the emperors left their names upon the tip of spear.\nWith that, he raised the broken spear up high, and made a great thrust against the massive gate before the deafening roars woke him.\nThe great ring in the distance opened up the sea. That piercing spear, the monumental construct forged by every faction with every moment of despair, every sliver of hope, and every weeping wound, was thrust into the heavens above.\n\nAnd on ██/██, ██, was Dijiang successfully launched."
